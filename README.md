# ControllerDriver
A linux driver for a controller made using the Linux USB and Input subsystems.

I used a gamecube controller to test the driver, so there are some mappings missing (such as shoulder button).

This project has an educational purpose, I do not recommend using it in place of the already installed drivers.
